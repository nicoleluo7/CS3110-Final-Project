  We're building an Interactive Propositional Logic Prover that allows
  users to construct and explore proofs through a REPL interface centered
  on automated reasoning and proof state management.
  
  Users can add premises one at a time or load them in batches from a script,
  after which the system automatically applies inference rules to expand the proof
  state by deriving new consequences.

  The prover maintains both the original and derived premises in its proof state,
  and users can query whether a given goal follows from the accumulated proof state.
